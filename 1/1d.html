<p>Hello, World!</p>
My name is Shreya Hiwarkar, and if there’s one thing that sets my heart on fire, it’s HTML. There’s something incredibly magical about taking a blank canvas and bringing it to life with just a few lines of code. It’s like I’m an artist, and HTML is my brush, letting me paint vivid, interactive stories on the web. Each tag, each element—it’s not just code to me; it’s a language that speaks to my soul, allowing me to craft experiences that others can touch, feel, and navigate. HTML isn’t just a skill; it’s a passion that I carry with pride, knowing that with every page I create, I’m leaving a piece of myself in the digital world.
